##Study Design 

#This section covers how data is collected.

#This course project is to prepare a set of data for analysis.  This set of data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
#Pls refer to http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones for details
